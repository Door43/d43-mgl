  * **[[:mgl:obe:other:gideon]]**
  * **[[:mgl:obe:other:king]]**

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **did not allow them to do this** - Gideon knew that it was better for the Israelites to have God as their king.
  * **but he asked them** â€“ This phrase starts with "but" because what he did next was not wise.
